# Flutter Clean Architecture

Am building sample app to demonstrate clean code principles with dart.

# Main Concepts:

- [Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture Principles](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-architecture-a/9780134494272/)

- [Unit Testing](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/testing/unit/introduction#2-create-a-test-file)

- [Service Locator](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it)

- [State Management with BLoc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)

# Architecture Proposal
